====== Abstractions ======

A VSCP unit is  describing it's configuration to the world with a register model where each register is eight bit in width. This is often inconvenient for a human user who is used to higher level types and this is what //abstractions// are there for. They sit above registers and specify types as strings, floats, integers and other such higher level types.

===== Counters =====

Real time counter values that will increase or decrease over time, depending on settings in the counters control register, if a pulse is available on the channel. 

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  counter0  |  uint32_t  | Counter for channel 0 |
|  counter1  |  uint32_t  | Counter for channel 1 |
|  counter2  |  uint32_t  | Counter for channel 2 |
|  counter3  |  uint32_t  | Counter for channel 3 |

===== Frequency =====

Frequency for the signal on the channel.


^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  frequency0  |  uint32_t  | Frequency for channel 0 |
|  frequency1  |  uint32_t  | Frequency for channel 1 |
|  frequency2  |  uint32_t  | Frequency for channel 2 |
|  frequency3  |  uint32_t  | Frequency for channel 3 |

===== k constants for linearization =====

Linearization is available so a measurement y can be calculated from 

  y = k*x + m

where x is either the current counter value for a channel or the current frequency for a channel.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_k  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point k-constant for linearization of channel 0 counter/frequency value. |
|  ch1_k  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point k-constant for linearization of channel 1 counter/frequency value. |
|  ch2_k  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point k-constant for linearization of channel 2 counter/frequency value. |
|  ch3_k  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point k-constant for linearization of channel 3 counter/frequency value. |

===== m constants for linearization =====

Linearization is available so a measurement y can be calculated from 

  y = k*x + m

where x is either the current counter value for a channel or the current frequency for a channel.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_m0  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point m-constant for linearization of channel 0 counter/frequency value. |
|  ch1_m1  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point m-constant for linearization of channel 1 counter/frequency value. |
|  ch2_m2  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point m-constant for linearization of channel 2 counter/frequency value. |
|  ch3_m3  |  float  | A 32-bit floating point m-constant for linearization of channel 3 counter/frequency value. |

===== Counter alarm levels =====

Counter alarm level. If the counter go above (or below) this value an alarm will be issued (if active). The alarm will be flagged in the alarm register and the alarm condition is rested if the counter value goes below counter value - hysteresis. 

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  cnt0_alarm_level  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter alarm level for channel 0. |
|  cnt1_alarm_level  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter alarm level for channel 1. |
|  cnt2_alarm_level  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter alarm level for channel 2. |
|  cnt3_alarm_level  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter alarm level for channel 3. |

===== Counter hysteresis =====

Counter hysteresis is the value the counter should drop with before an alarm condition is no longer active. This means that the next time the limit is passed the alarm condition is active again.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  cnt0_hysteresis  |  uint16_t  | A 16-bit counter hysteresis value for channel 0. |
|  cnt1_hysteresis  |  uint16_t  | A 16-bit counter hysteresis value for channel 1. |
|  cnt2_hysteresis  |  uint16_t  | A 16-bit counter hysteresis value for channel 2. |
|  cnt3_hysteresis  |  uint16_t  | A 16-bit counter hysteresis value for channel 3. |

===== Counter reload values =====

This is a value reloaded (if activated) to the counter when it counts down to zero.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  cnt0_reload  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter reload value for channel 0. |
|  cnt1_reload  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter reload value for channel 1. |
|  cnt2_reload  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter reload value for channel 2. |
|  cnt3_reload  |  uint32_t  | A 32-bit counter reload value for channel 3. |



=====  Frequency low alarms =====

Frequency low alarm level. Alarm condition is active if the frequency goes below this value. The alarm condition is active until the frequency go up to a value that is this value plus configured frequency hysteresis.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  freq0_alarm_low  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit low alarm level for frequency 0. |
|  freq1_alarm_low  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit low alarm level for frequency 1. |
|  freq2_alarm_low  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit low alarm level for frequency 2. |
|  freq3_alarm_low  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit low alarm level for frequency 3. |

=====  Frequency high alarms =====

Frequency high alarm level. Alarm condition is active if the frequency goes above this value. The alarm condition is active until the frequency go down to a value that is this value minus configured frequency hysteresis.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  freq0_alarm_high  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit high alarm level for frequency 0. |
|  freq1_alarm_high  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit high alarm level for frequency 1. |
|  freq2_alarm_high  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit high alarm level for frequency 2. |
|  freq3_alarm_high  |  uint16_t  | A 32-bit high alarm level for frequency 3. |

=====  Frequency hysteresis =====

This is the hysteresis used for frequency high/low alarms.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  freq0_hysteresis  |  uint16_t  | A 16-bit hysteresis value for frequency 0. |
|  freq1_hysteresis  |  uint16_t  | A 16-bit hysteresis value for frequency 1. |
