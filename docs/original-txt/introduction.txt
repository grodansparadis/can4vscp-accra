{{ :accra3.png?600 | Accra }}

Accra is a module that have four counter channels that each can count pulses and measure frequency. Each channel can have alarms set for going over a counter level or when counting down to zero and for a frequency that goes outside of a specified frequency window.

It has a built-in linear calculation algorithm that can translate pulse to real world measurement units. This can for example be used for utility meter measurements and gives the correct measurement value sent out on the VSCP bus.

**Kilafors** will be supplied later as an add on modules to detect S0 (IR) pulses so that Accra can be hooked on to an electrical meter and output power usage data.

The module comes with a GUID and is programmed with a bootloader and VSCP module functionality that works right out of the box.
